CompHound is a cloud-based universal component and asset usage analysis, report, bill of material and visualisation project providing sample code for two presentations on connecting the desktop with the cloud at
[RTC Europe](http://www.rtcevents.com/rtc2015eu) in Budapest end of October and
[Autodesk University](http://au.autodesk.com) in Las Vegas in December.

It currently consists of two parts:

- [CompHoundWeb](https://github.com/CompHound/CompHoundWeb),
a Node.js web server, mongo database and
[Autodesk View and Data API](https://developer.autodesk.com) viewer.
- [CompHoundRvt](https://github.com/CompHound/CompHoundRvt),
a Revit add-in to populate the CompHound web database with Â±BIM family instances.

This project is based on and derived from the node.js mongodb web server for the **FireRating in the Cloud** sample, consisting of the
[FireRatingCloud](https://github.com/jeremytammik/FireRatingCloud) C# .NET REST API client Revit add-in and the
[fireratingdb](https://github.com/jeremytammik/firerating) Node.js mongoDB web server.

In addition to that, this project also sports a user interface, including report, bill of material,
[Autodesk View and Data API](https://developer.autodesk.com) 2D and 3D model analysis, viewing and navigation functionality.
